# Title: Automated Left Ventricular Segmentation for Medical Analysis

### Short Summary: For the capstone computer science class CISC 4900, I decided to do a pure machine learning project on cardiac segmentation.


## Introduction

### Understand What The Heart Is
The heart is a muscular organ responsible for pumping blood throughout the body, delivering oxygen and nutrients to tissues and organs while removing waste products. 
It consists of four chambers: the left and right atria, which receive blood from the body and lungs respectively, and the left and right ventricles, which pump blood to the body and lungs respectively. 
The heart also contains valves that regulate the flow of blood between its chambers and major blood vessels.

### What Is Segmentation:
Typically when a patient has heart complications, medical professionals (usually cardiologists) order that the patient gets a range of imaging done on their heart. 
After this, a medical imaging specialist segments the images to isolate the heart or its muscles so that the doctor or cardiologist can use the images to plan treatments. 
The segmentation involves separating structures around the heart and from the heart so that a doctor can just look at the images and plan for the patient. 
This process, however, of segmenting the cardiac structures takes time and is just now starting to be automated with machine learning. 
By being able to segment a patient's organs faster and with accuracy, heart specialists can spend more time planning for the treatment of their patient because they can see their patient's heart. [^1]

### My Objective:
The goal of this project is to make and evaluate a machine-learning model for the automated segmentation of cardiac magnetic resonance images (MRI). [^2]
The model would be able to accurately segment the left ventricle to enable heart specialists and doctors to better diagnose and treat their patients. I don't believe there is enough time in the course to make it into a usable tool where a doctor could put an MRI of what may be a left ventricle. Therefore I will use the semester to make, tune, and then compare my model to others, such as those available in the MONAI Model Zoo.[^3]

### Methodology:
1. Obtain a dataset for training, validation, and testing [^2]
2. Preprocess the data. Account for color, and image resolution and normalize their values.
3. Either design a convolutional neural network that uses the u-net schema or (very likely) use transfer learning
4. Train the model using the annotated dataset, employing techniques such as data augmentation, transfer learning, and fine-tuning to enhance generalization
5. Evaluate the performance of the trained model using quantitative metrics, including Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and Hausdorff distance
6.  Validate the generalizability and clinical utility of the automated segmentation framework using an independent test set from some set the model has never seen
7.  Attempt to make the model into a usable tool where a user can input an image, and the model will be able to segment the image accurately

### Instructions:
The data was broken up into thirds due to GitHub not allowing pushes of files bigger than 100 MB. All you have to do is put the thirds into a single directory and keep the beginning part of the directory name i.e Training_Data, Validation_Data, Testing_Data. 
However, these datasets were only used for generating the binary masks. I then took the images in each dataset that only had binary masks and placed them in separate directories, organized by patients (and by which dataset they come from) to simplify the training process. These directories start with mask_and_mri...zip.
